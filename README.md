# hello-world
Hi there üëãüèº, my name is Daniel and this is my first time using GitHub.

## About me
So I'm 18 and I live in Portugal but I speak english fluently.
I like to learn stuff related to things i like for example programming languages that interest me such as Web Dev languages or C#, I also like to learn new languages as i know english, a bit of spanish, russian, german (learned in school) and am currently trying to learn french to speak at least basic. All the others languages except english and spanish I know a little too and need to sharp them.
I also know basic C# and html.

### School
I have completed 12th grade this year though im going to miss university partly because of my grades but mostly because I only chose 1 option.
What I chose to pursue in university was anything related with technology that involved programming as i enjoy the look of it and how it works, it is something i always wanted to do since kid so that is what I will be aiming to pursue in the future.
Since I have a whole year without anything to do im currently looking for a job and studying HTML as i found it interesting and i decided to buy a web dev course in which I have already learned basic html and i still have lots of new things to learn in the next few weeks (CSS, JS, JQuery, Bootstrap, Node.Js, PHP, MySql).

### Why i created a GitHub account
So as I said earlier, I'm currently learning web dev and have already learned basic HTML.
I am aiming to learn as much as I can about programming in different languages to prepare myself for university next year so I made this GitHub account to save and post my projects that I'll make after completing my web dev course and to post my university projects too in the next years.
